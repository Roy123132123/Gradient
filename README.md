An Example of all gradients in basic html and css

**Linear gradient**

A linear gradient is a gradient that goes horizontaly,verticaly or diagonally.

First enter the direction then the color opsit from where the gradient is going to, then the color then end color and then you can add colors you want in between the and and the begin color and end color

You can use and angle as the dircection by adding a angle in degrees

You can use a repeating linear gradient to repeat a linear gradient by using repeating-linear-gradient gradient in stead of linear-gradient when setting the background image

You can use transparency by using the rgba colors where the first color is red then blue then green and then the opacity wich goes from 0(completly opaqe)to 1 (completly visable)


**Radial gradient**

A radial gradient is a gradient defined by its center.

First enter the shape then set the center position and then the first color and then you can add as many colors you want after that one wich are going in the order of the most left being the most center color and the most right color being the most outside color.

You can use these direction keywords

closest-side

farthest-side

closest-corner

farthest-corner

**Conic gradient**

A conic a gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.
Its definded by the first argument being from wich angle you want the gradient to start then the second argument is what position you want it to start at and then the first color and an optional angle in degrees and then you can add as many colors as you would like.

You can use border-radius 50% to make the gradient look like a circle

**Repeating gradients**
**Linear:** You can use a repeating linear gradient to repeat a linear gradient by using repeating-linear-gradient gradient in stead of linear-gradient when setting the background image.
**Radial**  You can use a repeating radial gradient to repeat a radial gradient by using repeating-radial-gradient gradient in stead of radial-gradient when setting the background image.
**Conic**   You can use a repeating conic gradient to repeat a conic gradient by using repeating-conic-gradient gradient in stead of conic-gradient when setting the background image.
